## Everything about JavaScript

- JavaScript is a multiparadigm interpreted scripting language. 
- It was created in 1993 by **Brendan Eich at Netscape** in 10days.
- It's Standard implementations was called **EcmaScript**. Ecmascript are some protocols for JS.
- At first it was called **Mocha** but later was renamed to JavaScript because they wanted the popularity of Java.
- JS is dynamically typed which means it doesn't require data type declarations.
- JavaScript is the native language of the web aside [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).
- JavaScript is used everywhere including websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, servers and so on.
- JavaScript can also be called compiled with the help of **V8 Engine**.

## EcmaScript Related

- In 1996 Netscape made a deal with the organization known as ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to draft the specification of the JavaScript language, and in 1997 the first edition of the ECMAScript specification was published.
- You can think of a standard as an agreed-upon way of how things should work. Thus, ECMA-262 specifies how the JavaScript language should work.
- JavaScript as a language is not a completely separate, stand-alone entity. It only exists as an implementation. This implementation is known as a JavaScript engine.
- Traditionally, the only environment in which it was possible to run a JavaScript engine, was the browser. More specifically, a JavaScript engine was just another building block of the browser. It was there to help a browser accomplish its users' goal of utilizing the internet for work, research, and play.
- When developers write JavaScript code, they are using it to interact with a **JavaScript engine.** Put differently, developers write JavaScript code so that they can **"talk to**" a **JavaScript engine.**
- Additionally, the **JavaScript engine itself comes with different ways to interact with various other parts of the browser. These are known as Browser APIs.**
- Thus, the code that you write in the JavaScript programming language allows you to:
  - **Interact with the JavaScript engine inside of the browser** 
  - **Interact with other browser functionality that exists outside of the JavaScript engine, but is still inside the browser.**
    

## Things changed with Nodejs

- Although traditionally it was possible to interact with the JavaScript engine only inside of the browser, this all changed in 2009, when Node.js was built by Ryan Dahl.
- He came up with a way to use a JavaScript engine as a stand-alone entity. Suddenly, it was possible to use JavaScript outside of the browser, as a separate program on the command line, or as a server-side environment.

Today, JavaScript is ubiquitous and is running in browsers, on servers, actually, on any device that can run a JavaScript engine.
