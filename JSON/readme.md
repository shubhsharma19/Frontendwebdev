## JavaScript Object Notation

- Lightweight data interchange format, easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- Often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing and exchanging data.

- The syntax of a JSON file is based on a collection of key-value pairs, with each key and its corresponding value separated by a colon, and each pair separated by a comma. The entire collection is wrapped in curly braces {} to indicate that it is an object. Basically a JS object.

```JSON
{
  "name": "Shubh",
  "age": 23,
  "city": "Bareilly"
}

```

In this above example, **"name"**, **"age"**, and **"city"** are the keys, and **"Shubh"**, **23**, and **"Bareilly"** are their corresponding values.

> Note: In JSON files, string values are enclosed in double quotes, while numeric values and boolean values are not.

- JSON can also represent arrays, which are collections of values separated by commas and wrapped in square brackets []. Here is an example of a JSON array:

```JSON
[  "apple",  "banana",  "cherry"]
```
