## What is an http protocol?

HTTP is a set of rules that define how information is exchanged between two machines over the internet. 

It is the foundation of data communication on the web and is widely used for fetching resources like **HTML documents, images, style sheets, etc.**

Some other examples of protocols **https, ftp, webrtc, imap, pop3, smtp, dns, tcp/ip, udp.**

## How frontend communicates with backend?

Frontend and backend communication often relies on HTTP protocol. The frontend (client-side) sends HTTP requests to the backend (server-side), and the backend responds with the requested data or performs the requested actions. This interaction is crucial for dynamic web apps where data needs to be exchanged between the user's device and the server.

## HTTP Server

Some code that follows http protocols and is able to communicate with client side. An http server responds to the client's requests.

Think of it as a calling app on mobile using which you can call a friend.

In short, a client sends a req, server does something with that data, and then responds back to the client with something.
